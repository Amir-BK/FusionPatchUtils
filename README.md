# FusionPatchUtils
Unreal plugin that creates Fusion samples patch assets from SFZ and Decent Sampler presets

## Usage

Import (or drag & drop) an .sfz file or a .dspreset to your content browser:

As SFZ and DSpresets are used in samplers that have way more features than the fusion sampler there are many op-codes and options that are lost in the conversion so don't expect the result to sound the same as the original soundfont, this tool works best for simple instruments. 

For better results using SFZ please see my Sfizz4Unreal plugin that uses Sfizz directly to render SFZ and produces accurate results from SFZ soundfonts: https://github.com/Amir-BK/Sfizz4Unreal/
